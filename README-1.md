# Python

In this Python project I have related Python with PHPMyAdmin.
In the project, a user has two options:
-Register in the system by entering your data.
-Enter with your data in the account.

If the user has an account, he can access different options:
Available actions:
-Create note (create)
-Show your notes (show)
-Remove note (delete)
-Go out (go_out)

These options will be saved in PHPMyAdmin and the user can access the information whenever they want.
